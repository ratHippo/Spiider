# website-generator

## About:
Right now this python script is set up to generate my website. It can take markdown files, html files, and json files, using both markdown and json for metadata. 

### Dependencies

```bash
pip install json markdown markdown-full-yaml-metadata
```

## Future:
  In order to make this usable for your own website, I'll seperate the configuration from the program and make another program to generate the directory and the configuration file for you.
